# Traffic SignsðŸš¦ Detection
<p>In this era of Artificial Intelligence, humans are becoming more dependent on technology. With the enhanced technology, multinational companies like Google, Tesla, Uber, Ford, Audi, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, and many more are working on automating vehicles. They are trying to make more accurate autonomous or driverless vehicles. You all might know about self-driving cars, where the vehicle itself behaves like a driver and does not need any human guidance to run on the road. This is not wrong to think about the safety aspectsâ€”a chance of significant accidents from machines. But no machines are more accurate than humans. Researchers are running many algorithms to ensure 100% road safety and accuracy.</p>
